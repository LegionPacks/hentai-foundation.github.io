<h2 id="areas">Areas</h2>
<h3 id="hub-area">Hub area</h3>
<p>This is where you start the game. Dino will be the first NPC you talk to, and he will be your guide to the game (“server”). Other NPCs will be here as well (Huntress, heretic) who have quests for you to complete while you go through all the different areas.</p>
<p>Dino tells you of the goal of the game, which is to decipher the blacksheets copypasta. In so doing, he gives you the main questline (which is to collect all the CLOB fragments).</p>
<h4 id="minecraft-subarea">Minecraft subarea</h4>
<p>Kerisvect is an NPC here. He has a pet robot named cartier (the minecraft bot). Another NPC here is The friend who, when talked to, will only say “The friend” or “do NOT post Dong in the Fuck.”</p>
<p>Yet another NPC here is Eddie. He shows up later in the Final area to talk about the thot chamber. For now, though, he only discusses Big Texas and railroad-building.</p>
<h5 id="wildlife-reserve-sub-subarea">Wildlife reserve sub-subarea</h5>
<p>There is a small area off of the Minecraft area which is a WildLife reserve. Okami is the only NPC here at first. After you defeat enemies / bosses they are displayed here.</p>
<h4 id="china-subarea-only-unlocked-after-defeating-the-softwarehardware-area">China subarea (only unlocked after defeating the Software/Hardware area)</h4>
<p>Rogue is the NPC here. He is very interested in China, and also the KQID Leo KoGuan propaganda. You can buy weed from Rogue, which will increase your boner size (maximum health).</p>
<p>Shay (“Q”) is also here. He is very anti-China and thus he shittalks Rogue.</p>
<h4 id="gamming-subarea">Gamming subarea</h4>
<p>There may be some minigames here. Kaisomir will guide you through them (maybe he has a quest where you have to beat the Tetris one?).</p>
<p>No Thanks is a character here. He says something about Destiny 2 but it is so incomprehensible that you do not understand it. (He says “nigga” a lot.)</p>
<p>One of the games here is the Meme Economy RPG. This is indeed recursion, and is thus blocked off with a sign that says “no recursion allowed” or something to that effect.</p>
<h3 id="softwarehardware-area">Software/Hardware area</h3>
<p>Lawful Lazy is here as an NPC, and will be useless as he is busy talking about either Hexstream (and how he is making the Common Lisp community look bad) or Emacs and how it is better than Vim. Another NPC is Arsole, and another NPC is MIP5.</p>
<p>Here you will also meet Vord, who will initially have dubious moral leanings – he is a moderator of the Stonetoss discord and the owner of a SuperStraight discord. However, after you talk to him/beat him in a fight, he will switch to your side and become a useful ally.</p>
<p>After meeting/beating Vord, you will unlock the robot Terobot as a pet, who will speak copypastas at random.</p>
<h3 id="anime-area">Anime area</h3>
<p>Here there is a Depraved Cult, with ⑨ (9) symbolism present. Members of this cult include Vig and UnholyRazzberry.</p>
<p>Rshig is an NPC here, who gives you the quest to “ban” Vig (defeat him in the boss battle).</p>
<h3 id="horny-area">Horny area</h3>
<p>One NPC here is Mars, who is a disgraceful furry. Vixen is another NPC; she tries to get you to join her harem. (Your dialogue options politely decline.)</p>
<p>The boss for this area is Sixxth, the man who literally posted his dong on Meme Economy NSFW.</p>
<h4 id="femboy-subarea">Femboy subarea</h4>
<p>Here there is an optional bossfight against Tyson, the Femboy Lord. If you defeat him you will be able to get out of the No Thanks fight because he will be happy that you made Tyson shut up. Carc is here as an NPC as well (he does not like to be compared to cark who is on Twitter).</p>
<h3 id="final-area">Final area</h3>
<p>The final area is a flashback to the old Meme Economy. All of the members who left are there. The Eldrich Cult contains some of these members. Others may appear in the form of NPCs. (One such NPC is Eddie, who tries to discuss the thot chamber with you at great depth but you do not care because it is boring.)</p>
<p>Other NPCs are Ele_, Jim, felface, darkpitt, and Liar.</p>
<p>After fighting the Eldritch Cult you will gain the last fragment of CLOB. This will cause CubeBag to betray you and begin the final bossfight, after which you complete the game.</p>
<h4 id="banned-subarea-called-brazil">Banned subarea (called Brazil)</h4>
<p>This subarea contains all the bad banned users, including Jarb, Evilcookie, and Janitor. They are in jail or some other symbolic area, where their bannable offenses are listed near them. An empty cell reads “Vord”, with the offense of “too many strikes.”</p>
<p>An NPC here is Ioyz (because he is Brazilian). The security guard is the robot Strikesy.</p>
<h2 id="gameplay-mechanics">Gameplay mechanics</h2>
<h3 id="health-stamina-armor-etc.">Health, stamina, armor, etc.</h3>
<p>Your health is referred to as your “boner”. You can increase your maximum health by buying weed from Rogue in the China subarea of the main Hub.</p>
<p>Stamina is not implemented.</p>
<p>You can buy armor from Kerisvect in the Minecraft subarea.</p>
<h3 id="area-layout-and-progression">Area layout and progression</h3>
<p>Each large area is simply a large room, with various houses inside it (for small subareas) or paths to other rooms on the edges (for larger subareas).</p>
<p>The large areas (besides the Hub) have a portal in the center which leads back to the Hub area. The Hub area has portals to each of the large areas that are unlocked in order (Software/Hardware, Anime, Horny, Gamming, Final). The Software/Hardware area, which is the first real outside area, will be unlocked after Dino gives you the server tour.</p>
<h3 id="currency">Currency</h3>
<p>The currency will, of course, be Garlicoin. You can get Garlicoin from defeating enemies and completing quests. Vendors (Rogue, Kerisvect) will accept Garlicoin as payment.</p>

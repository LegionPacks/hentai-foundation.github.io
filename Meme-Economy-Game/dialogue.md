There are lots of NPCs and enemies in this game. This document has all of their dialogue laid out, by area (so that it's easy to look through here while I'm making the game).

## Hub area

 - Dino
   - When just meeting you:
     - "Hi there, and welcome to Meme Economy. I'm Dino, the owner of this server."
     - "The server has gotten a bit out of hand, and I'm looking for your help in fixing it up again."
     - "In order to fix it up, I'll need something powerful to keep all the members in check. That thing is..."
     - "The origin of the Blacksheets copypasta. This copypasta is known for its mysterious nature and elusive origin."
     - "Player, I need your help in deciphering this copypasta."
     - "To decipher the origin of the Blacksheets copypasta, you must collect all the CLOB fragments scattered throughout the server."
     - "These fragments are the key to the recreation of the CLOB Co, who developed the Blacksheets copypasta in a secret lab several years ago. Only by gathering them all will you be able to resurrect the CLOB Co, and thus decipher the sacred texts."
     - "Go to it then! Enter the portals, collect the CLOB fragments, and return. This is the beginning of something epic."
   - When you collect one CLOB piece:
     - "Would you look at that -- a piece of CLOB. Amazing. There are only (n) left!"
   - When you collect two CLOB pieces:
     - "This is pretty cool. You got two CLOB pieces! Now we are even closer to our goal."
   - When you collect three CLOB pieces:
     - "Ok, this is epic. Three whole CLOB pieces! I can barely make out the first line... it looks like it says 'CLOB CLANG...' Keep up the good work!"
   - When you collect four CLOB pieces:
     - "Based moment. You got four whole pieces of CLOB! We're getting closer..."
   - When you collect five CLOB pieces:
     - "This is an epic gamer moment. Five pieces of CLOB have been discovered... It looks like I can read a little more: 'CLOVISOBONG...'"
   - When you collect six CLOB pieces:
     - ...
   - When you collect all the CLOB pieces (Dino will be in the Final area when you do):
     - "The final CLOB piece. Now we have them all..."
     - "You have truly exceeded my expectations. Now we can finally decipher the origin of the Blacksheets copypasta..."
     - → Cubebag triggers a bossfight:
       - Cubebag: "Not if I have anything to say about it! Prepare to die, Player!"
       - Dino: "Why are you doing this, Cubebag? I thought you were helping Player!"
       - Cubebag: "I was only waiting for a chance to strike -- now that you've come this far, I can't let you decipher my child in its entirety!"
       - Dino: "What?! *YOU* were the one who wrote the Blacksheets copypasta?!"
       - Cubebag: "And what if I was? It doesn't matter anymore. Die!"
       - (bossfight)
 - Huntress
   - "Hi Player, and welcome to Meme Economy."
   - "I'm Huntress, a recent addition to the Admin team."
   - "I need your help! I'm trying to organize all the Hpocks for my alignment chart. If you see any Hpocks out in the server, make sure you bring them to me! I'll reward you handsomely."
 - Heretic
   - "Hi there Player, I'm heretic. I'm rarely in this server much nowadays, but I'm here now because I need help working on my latest mixtape, called 'Cirno reverb through a cassete on Kaiheila Economy'."
   - "I've run into an issue though -- I need a [cassete], and a [Cirno soundbyte], and a [link to the Kaiheila discord server]. If you can find these things and bring them back to me I'll be forever in your service."

### Minecraft subarea

   - "As you might have heard from Arsole, Vord's shitty morals are seeping out of this area rapidly, infecting the rest of Meme Economy."
   - "In order to stop them, you'll need to go into the SuperStraight discord through this wormhole, after which you'll have a choice..."
